I had an impulse to visualize the (pretty obvious) observation that progressive politics is correlated with population density. <br/>

* Understanding the visualization

Each circle in the scatterplot is a county; size represents population.<br/>
The x-axis of the scatterplot is the population density (people/km<sup>2</sup>) on a log scale.<br/>
The y-axis is % of the vote that went to Obama in the 2012 presidential election.<br/>

Try selecting a region in the scatterplot or map.

* Data sources

Election results: scraped from Politico: http://www.politico.com/2012-election/results/president/alabama/
